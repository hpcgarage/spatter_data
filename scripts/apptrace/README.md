## Proxy app trace generation and usage with Spatter

* Scripts to generate the traces used in the SC19 paper will be forthcoming. Right now, these traces require close to a day to generate and several days to process.
* We plan to add the "Spatter proxy app" trace to this repo in the near future, once we decide how to compress them. They are still quite large at 100-300 MB.

The scripts included in this directory demonstrate how we ran Spatter with the two main mini-apps in the paper, AMG and NEKBONE.
